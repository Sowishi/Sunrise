          The device AlzheiTech, whose main objective is monitoring and tracking
          the Alzheimer's patient and securing an immediate response in case of
          emergency, hence also increasing the patient’s safety. AlzheiTech
          integrates different features and functions such as the Global
          Positioning System (GPS) (1) which tracks and locates the patient, SMS
          (2) Emergency alert system, which notifies and provides necessary
          information. QR Code (3) contains basic information such as the
          contact numbers in which they can communicate with the caretakers or
          relatives in case that someone encounters the patient who got lost.
          The Event Stream Processes (ESP) Basepoint (4) serves as a reference
          for the device, triggering an alarm when it exceeds a designated range
          from the basepoint. This proximity-based alarm system ensured timely
          notifications if the wearable device ventured too far from the
          established distance threshold. Then, a custom-made Application (5)
          was developed, exclusive for use to provide the necessary profile,
          collect and receive information from the GPS. Eventually, the
          information gathered using the mentioned features was processed by
          AlzhieTech to provide a location and information about the patient
          with Alzheimer's.
